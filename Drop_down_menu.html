					The Ultimate CSS Gradient Editor was created by Alex Sirota (iosart). If you like this tool, check out ColorZilla for more advanced tools such as eyedroppers, color pickers, palette editors and website analyzers.

					As you might know, HTML5 introduced many exciting features for Web developers. One of the features is the ability to specify gradients using pure CSS3, without having to create any images and use them as repeating backgrounds for gradient effects.

					Important: You'll need a recent version of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera or IE to use this Gradient Generator. The resulting CSS gradients are cross-browser - they will work in these browsers and will also fall back to a simpler gradient in older versions of Internet Explorer.The Ultimate CSS Gradient Editor was created by Alex Sirota (iosart).
